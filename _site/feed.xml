Most of the core features, like feed, wiki-links becoming hyperlinks, backlinks, etc., are slightly modified versions of the Simple Jekyll theme. I have tried not to break features from the theme, but I am not sure as I don't use many of them. &lt;a href=&quot;https://simply-jekyll.netlify.app/posts/explore&quot;&gt;Check Simply Jekyll features here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;note-feed&quot;&gt;Note feed&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jekyll garden comes with a feed-like display of all notes. There is a frontmatter value called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;notetype&lt;/code&gt; using which you can decide if notes need to be displayed or not on the feed. Use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;notetype:feed&lt;/code&gt; to show, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;notetype:unfeed&lt;/code&gt;. Read more at  [[The story of a hidden note]]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;feed-as-homepage&quot;&gt;Feed as Homepage&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The current configuration of this theme contains a homepage, and feed is generated at /notes. You can make the feed homepage by modifying &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;homepage: enabled&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; in _config.yml.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;content-files&quot;&gt;Content Files&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To modify homepage content, edit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_includes/Homepage.html&lt;/code&gt;. Similarly, to edit feed intro, make changes at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_includes/FeedContent.html&lt;/code&gt;. To modify the navigation part, edit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_includes/Header.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;limitations--tags&quot;&gt;Limitations : Tags&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This theme doesn't support #tags inside the story. Tags using frontend YAML is possible, but it will be a single file index as auto-generating pages per Tag is complex using Github pages. (I might add this in the next version, if I can crack how to, and if there is a demand)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;limitations--images&quot;&gt;Limitations : Images&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jekyll doesn't render images or attachments inside collection folders, and it suggests &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/assets/img/&lt;/code&gt; to accommodate all images. You can make the entire GitHub repo your Obsidian vault, but I felt it cluttered to see code along with my notes. My notes have significantly fewer images, and hence, for now, I manually paste images to assets and copy relative URLs to Obsidian. (but I am not sure if it's the best way)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This theme is a fork of the Simply Jekyll theme , which I used for around six months before building this one.

        Setting up a Jekyll Garden is a simple task for both new users and existing Obsidian users. This document explains how to fork this Jekyll theme, start using it via Github pages, and configure the Obsidian folders and frontmatter. 
        ### Github Setup
        **Step 1**: Sign-In to Github, visit the [theme page](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io) and click on 'Use this Template'
        &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/img/1-how-to.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
        **Step 2**: Name the forked repo as `yourusername.github.io`. My Github username is hfactor, hence it's hfactor.github.io
        &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/img/2-how-to.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
        **Step 3**: Go to your repo's settings &gt; pages and set the source to your main branch. 
        &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/img/3-how-to.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
        Step 4 (Optional): If you have a custom domain, set [CNAME](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https). 
        Claps! The Jekyll website with a Note Garden theme is ready. Visit  `yourusername.github.io` to see that. 
        _If it's not working, edit this readme (add something and commit) to trigger static page generation._
        ### Github to your Desktop
        Step 1: Go to `yourusername.github.io`, and clone your repository to your machine. For this, you can use git-commands or install [Github for desktop.](https://desktop.github.com/) 
        &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/img/4-how-to.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
        Step 2: Once you have successfully cloned the repository to your machine, Open the Obsidian app, and set the folder `_notes` inside the repository as your vault. 
        &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/img/5-how-to.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
        ## Obsidian
        Choosing the `_notes` folder as your vault is critical, Once done, you can start adding notes to this vault and add frontmatter to support. 
        Read about theme's frontmatter at [[Welcome to the garden]]
        &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/img/6-how-to.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
        ## Frontmatter
        For all notes to work properly, we need to have three frontmatter values. (If you check this MD file, you will see them as the first five lines). 
        ```
        title:&quot;Filename&quot; 
        notetype: feed | unfeed 
        date: DD-MM-YYYY
        ```
        The title should be the same as that for the file name (for backlinks to work). `notetype` is used to declutter the feed by hiding less relevant, supporting-notes from the feed. The date is used to sort notes in the latest one first order. (I consider it as the last updated date than created date.). 
        ## Updating Digital Garden
        Once you have enough notes, got to the Github Desktop app, commit the changes to main, and push the changes to Github. Github will update the pages!
        &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/img/7-how-to.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;

        ## Notes
        The best part of Jekyll and Obsidian is that they use a standard markup language like [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to build notes. And hence, the content becomes independent of the tool. You can use any text editor like VSCode or atom or 1Writer for iPad to edit the text. Check for plugins that do autocomplete for [[ and that's all you need! Similarly, you can use the theme without syncing locally. You can directly add and edit notes using Github or tools like [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) and modify the content! 
        The best part of Obsidian is how it connects notes by auto-completing the wiki links and providing a graph view. I usually use 1Writer on iPad to make content, and Obsidian for cleanup, reading, and finding new connections. (Read my workflow)
