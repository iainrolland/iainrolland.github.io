        This theme is a fork of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll&quot;&gt;the Simply Jekyll theme &lt;/a&gt;,  which I used for around six months before building this one. Most of the core features, like feed, wiki-links becoming hyperlinks, backlinks, etc., are slightly modified versions of the Simple Jekyll theme. I have tried not to break features from the theme, but I am not sure as I don't use many of them. &lt;a href=&quot;https://simply-jekyll.netlify.app/posts/explore&quot;&gt;Check Simply Jekyll features here.&lt;/a&gt;
        ### Note feed
        Jekyll garden comes with a feed-like display of all notes. There is a frontmatter value called `notetype` using which you can decide if notes need to be displayed or not on the feed. Use `notetype:feed` to show, and `notetype:unfeed`. Read more at  [[The story of a hidden note]]
        ### Feed as Homepage
        The current configuration of this theme contains a homepage, and feed is generated at /notes. You can make the feed homepage by modifying `homepage: enabled` to `false` in _config.yml.
        ### Content Files
        To modify homepage content, edit `_includes/Homepage.html`. Similarly, to edit feed intro, make changes at `_includes/FeedContent.html`. To modify the navigation part, edit `_includes/Header.html`
        ### Limitations : Tags
        This theme doesn't support #tags inside the story. Tags using frontend YAML is possible, but it will be a single file index as auto-generating pages per Tag is complex using Github pages. (I might add this in the next version, if I can crack how to, and if there is a demand) 
        ###  Limitations : Images
        Jekyll doesn't render images or attachments inside collection folders, and it suggests `/assets/img/` to accommodate all images. You can make the entire GitHub repo your Obsidian vault, but I felt it cluttered to see code along with my notes. My notes have significantly fewer images, and hence, for now, I manually paste images to assets and copy relative URLs to Obsidian. (but I am not sure if it's the best way)
